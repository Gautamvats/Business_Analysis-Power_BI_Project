# Personal_Power_BI_Project 
Developed and deployed a comprehensive 4-page interactive Power BI dashboard, leveraging line charts, bar charts, and maps to visualise and analyse crucial sales data. I transformed and processed the data using DAX to ensure data completeness and validity. Additionally, I utilised Power BI's data modelling capabilities to integrate and transform multiple data sources, ensuring data accuracy and consistency, and enabling accurate and insightful analysis. Furthermore, I implemented dynamic filters and slicers within the dashboard, allowing users to drill down into specific time periods, product categories, and customer segments, thereby facilitating in-depth analysis and customised reporting.
