# Business Data Analysis Dashboard

### Project Overview

This project revolves around constructing a comprehensive data analysis dashboard with Microsoft Power BI. The dashboard tracks key performance indicators (KPIs), compares regional performance, analyzes product-level trends, and identifies high-value customers. By leveraging Power BI's capabilities, stakeholders gain access to visually presented insights for informed decision-making and business growth.

### Objectives

The objectives of this project are to:
- Develop a comprehensive data analysis dashboard using Microsoft Power BI.
- Track key performance indicators (KPIs) of the company.
- Compare regional performance across different locations.
- Analyze product-level trends over time.
- Identify high-value customers and their characteristics.
- Provide insights for informed decision-making and business growth.


### DataSets
- **Sales Data**: Dataset for analyzing company sales across years.
- **Sales Return Data**: Dataset for tracking and analyzing sales returns.
- **Customer Data**: Dataset containing customer information for segmentation and analysis.
- **Product Data**: Dataset providing details about company products for analysis.
- **Product Category Data**: Dataset categorizing products for organizational analysis.
- **Product Subcategory Data**: Dataset providing subcategory details for product analysis.
- **Territory Data**: Dataset containing information on sales territories for geographical analysis.

### Tools
- **Microsoft Power BI**
  - Power Query: Data Cleaning & Transformation
  - DAX (Data Analysis Expressions): Data Analysis
  - Visualization Tools: Creating Reports and Dashboards

 
### Methodology

- **Data Collection**: The project starts with importing raw datasets into Power BI using Power Query.
- **Data Preparation**: Using Power Query, the raw data is cleaned and structured to ensure consistency and accuracy.
- **Data Modeling**: The cleaned datasets are then modeled in Power BI to establish relationships between them.
- **Data Analysis**: Data analysis is conducted using DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) to derive meaningful insights into key performance indicators, product trends, regional performance, and customer behavior.
- **Visualization and Reporting**: Finally, the project concludes with the creation of visualizations and charts using Power BI's visualization tools.


### Data Analysis Questions
1. What are the key performance indicators (KPIs) of the company?
2. How does regional performance vary across different locations?
3. What are the trends in product sales over time?
4. Who are the high-value customers, and what are their characteristics?
5. Are there any correlations between sales, regional performance, product trends, and customer behavior?


### Findings
- The dashboard successfully tracks key performance indicators, allowing stakeholders to monitor the company's overall performance.
- Regional performance varies, with certain regions outperforming others. This insight enables targeted marketing and sales efforts.
- Product-level trends reveal which products are performing well and which ones may need attention or adjustment.
- High-value customers are identified, allowing for personalized marketing and customer retention strategies.
- Correlations between sales, regional performance, product trends, and customer behavior provide valuable insights for strategic decision-making.
